# Complete_Devops

In this repo I am going to practice complete devops fundamentals like
Containerization --->> Writing multistage dockerfile
create kubernetes manifest (deployment, service and Ingress)
CI ----> github actions
CD -----> Argo CD
kubernetes cluster( EKS) application will be deployed here
Helm charts for diff envs using values.yml
Ingress Controller to publicly exposed to everyone - load balancer
mapping load balancer with the DNS
